+Both Perfect Line and Measured Line plots have X axis values of only 0's. I.e. both lines have all of their points plotted along the Y axis ((x=0, y=0), (x=0, y=25%), (x=0, y=50%), etc). Instead, the X values for both line plots shall be equal to the 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% "perfect cal" pressures, respectively. For example, if the Zero is 0 and the 100% is 100, then the Perfect Line shall be plotted on these data points: (x=0, y=0), (25, 25), (50, 50), (75, 75), (100, 100). Then, if the user enters these as measured values: 0.5, 22, 54, 81, 99; then the "measured line" shall be plotted at these data points: (x=0, y=0.5), (25, 22), (50, 54), (75, 81), (100, 99). Note how the X values are always the same for both the perfect and measured lines. Also, for the perfect line, y = x for every point (linear line). However, for the Measured line, y=measured value for the respective data point.
